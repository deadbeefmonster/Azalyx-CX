A personal protocol research and Qt C++ programming project for the sole purpose of geeky enjoyment and fulfillment. 

I have no expectation of it ever being completed or usable for anyone's needs or requirements.

This is simply a fun personal project, and I'm only focusing on what I want out of it.
